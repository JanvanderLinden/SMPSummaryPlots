Choice of parameterization.

Three conventions

SU(2) respecting "LEP" senario or HISZ parameteriazation (mostly varified)
used by ATLAS and no one else
lambdas equal
delta(kappa_Z) = (delta(g^Z_1) - delta(kappa_gamma))*tan^2(theta_W)


SU(2) HISZ with fW=fB ATLAS only
lambdas equal

ATLAS delta(kappa_Z)= delta(g^Z_1) - delta(kappa_gamma)*tan^2(theta_W)
and through f_B=f_W
delta(kappa_Z)= (1/2)delta(kappa_gamma)*(1-tan^2(theta_W))


Equal coupling
lambdas equal
delta(kappa_Z) = delta(kappa_gamma)
delta(g^Z_1) = 0

Issues
I converted CMS and LEP deltakappagammas to deltakappaZ
In the LEP case I didn't treat the correlations carefully
In teh CMS case setting delta gZ1 to zero probably gives
 to good a result. It is not nearly as well constrained as
 we claim and adding the constraint would inflate the result.
